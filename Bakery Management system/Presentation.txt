Overview:
A simple Python-based system to manage bakery menu items and user accounts using file handling.

📌 Slide 2 — Why Bakery Owners Need This System
How This System Helps Bakery Owners

Centralized Menu Management
– Owners can easily add, delete, or update bakery items.

Faster Customer Service
– Quick search option helps staff locate items instantly.

Secure Access Control

Simple Employee Operations
– Staff (normal users) can view menu and update their own mobile details.

Low Cost & No Database Required
– Uses simple text files (users.txt, menu.txt) → ideal for small bakeries.

Organized, Accurate Digital Records
– Reduces the chance of errors from manual or paper-based records.

📌 Slide 5 — System Workflow
How the System Works

1️⃣ System starts → loads users.txt & menu.txt
2️⃣ User enters username and password
3️⃣ System checks credentials
4️⃣ If Admin → access admin panel
5️⃣ If User → access limited user panel
6️⃣ Every change is saved back to files

Ensures both data integrity and easy access.
